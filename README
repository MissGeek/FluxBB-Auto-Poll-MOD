#--- IMPORTANT ! ---
If you were using this MOD on FluxBB 1.4, the MOD versions prior to 1.2 had a wrong character set (latin1 instead of utf8) in the polls table.  Please use the update_from_1.1.php file to fix it.  For safety reasons, I recommend you to test it on a copy of your database before using it on your live board.  If there's any issue, please leave a report wether on Github, FluxBB.org or FluxBB.fr, and detail your issue as much as possible (server info, browser/OS info, etc.) !

I can give support in English and French.

#--- LOCALIZATION ---

For now, this MOD is available only in English and French.  If you speak another language (Spanish, German, Russian, etc.) as your mother tongue or if you are very fluent in it, feel free to propose a translation so I can add it in the repo with credits.
